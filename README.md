## Requirements
For Adaptive Sensitive Reweighting model `scipydirect` was used. `scipydirect` - a python wrapper to the DIRECT algorithm. The quickest way to install is to type: 
```
pip install scipydirect
```
To install [scipydirect](https://scipydirect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) you will need the following prerequisites: python 2.7 or 3.x, a FORTRAN compiler such as gfortran (for example, for Mac OS X [gcc](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc#default)), numpy, matplotlib.

## Datasets
Four datasets were used: [Adult Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset?select=adult.csv), [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing), [COMPAS dataset](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis), [KDD Census income dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+(KDD)). They are also available in this repositury, in Adaptive Sensitive Reweighting folder.
